  One-time pad

A format of one-time pad used by the U.S. National Security Agency
</wiki/National_Security_Agency>, code named DIANA. The table on the
right is an aid for converting between plaintext and ciphertext using
the characters at left as the key.

In cryptography </wiki/Cryptography>, the *one-time pad* (*OTP*) is an
encryption </wiki/Encryption> technique that cannot be cracked
</wiki/Cryptanalysis>, but requires the use of a one-time pre-shared key
the same size as the message being sent. In this technique, a plaintext
</wiki/Plaintext> is paired with a random secret key
</wiki/Key_(cryptography)> (also referred to as /a one-time pad/). Then,
each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with
the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition
</wiki/Modular_addition>. If the key is truly random </wiki/Random>, is
at least as long as the plaintext, is never reused in whole or in part,
and is kept completely secret </wiki/Secret>, then the resulting
ciphertext </wiki/Ciphertext> will be impossible to decrypt or
break.^[1] <#cite_note-Numbers_Stations-1> ^[2] <#cite_note-2> ^[3]
<#cite_note-3> It has also been proven that any cipher with the perfect
secrecy property must use keys with effectively the same requirements as
OTP keys.^[4] <#cite_note-shannon-4> However, practical problems have
prevented one-time pads from being widely used.

First described by Frank Miller </wiki/Frank_Miller_(cryptography)> in
1882,^[5] <#cite_note-5> ^[6] <#cite_note-BELLOVIN1-6> the one-time pad
was re-invented in 1917. On July 22, 1919, U.S. Patent 1,310,719 was
issued to Gilbert S. Vernam </wiki/Gilbert_Vernam> for the XOR
</wiki/Exclusive_or> operation used for the encryption of a one-time
pad.^[7] <#cite_note-Google-7> Derived from his /Vernam cipher/, the
system was a cipher that combined a message with a key read from a
punched tape </wiki/Punched_tape>. In its original form, Vernam's system
was vulnerable because the key tape was a loop, which was reused
whenever the loop made a full cycle. One-time use came later, when
Joseph Mauborgne </wiki/Joseph_Mauborgne> recognized that if the key
tape were totally random, then cryptanalysis </wiki/Cryptanalysis> would
be impossible.^[8] <#cite_note-8>

The "pad" part of the name comes from early implementations where the
key material was distributed as a pad of paper, so that the top sheet
could be easily torn off and destroyed after use. For ease of
concealment, the pad was sometimes reduced to such a small size that a
powerful magnifying glass </wiki/Loupe> was required to use it. The KGB
</wiki/KGB> used pads of such size that they could fit in the palm of
one's hand,^[9] <#cite_note-9> or in a walnut </wiki/Walnut> shell.^[10]
<#cite_note-10> To increase security, one-time pads were sometimes
printed onto sheets of highly flammable nitrocellulose
</wiki/Nitrocellulose>, so that they could be quickly burned after use.

There is some ambiguity to the term because some authors^[/who?
</wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions>/]
use the terms "Vernam cipher" and "one-time pad" synonymously, while
others refer to any additive stream cipher </wiki/Stream_cipher> as a
"Vernam cipher", including those based on a cryptographically secure
pseudorandom number generator
</wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator>
(CSPRNG).^[11] <#cite_note-kahn-11>

    History[edit </w/index.php?title=One-time_pad&action=edit&section=1>]

Frank Miller </wiki/Frank_Miller_(cryptography)> in 1882 was the first
to describe the one-time pad system for securing telegraphy.^[6]
<#cite_note-BELLOVIN1-6> ^[12] <#cite_note-bio-12>

The next one-time pad system was electrical. In 1917, Gilbert Vernam
</wiki/Gilbert_Vernam> (of AT&T Corporation </wiki/AT%26T_Corporation>)
invented and later patented in 1919 (U.S. Patent 1,310,719
<//www.google.com/patents/US1310719>) a cipher based on teleprinter
</wiki/Teleprinter> technology. Each character in a message was
electrically combined with a character on a paper tape
</wiki/Paper_tape> key. Joseph Mauborgne </wiki/Joseph_Mauborgne> (then
a captain </wiki/Captain_(U.S._Army)> in the U.S. Army </wiki/U.S._Army>
and later chief of the Signal Corps
</wiki/Signal_Corps_(United_States_Army)>) recognized that the character
sequence on the key tape could be completely random and that, if so,
cryptanalysis would be more difficult. Together they invented the first
one-time tape system.^[11] <#cite_note-kahn-11>

The next development was the paper pad system. Diplomats had long used
codes </wiki/Code> and ciphers </wiki/Cipher> for confidentiality and to
minimize telegraph </wiki/Telegraphy> costs. For the codes, words and
phrases were converted to groups of numbers (typically 4 or 5 digits)
using a dictionary-like codebook </wiki/Codebook>. For added security,
secret numbers could be combined with (usually modular addition) each
code group before transmission, with the secret numbers being changed
periodically (this was called superencryption </wiki/Superencryption>).
In the early 1920s, three German cryptographers (Werner Kunze, Rudolf
Schauffler and Erich Langlotz), who were involved in breaking such
systems, realized that they could never be broken if a separate randomly
chosen additive number was used for every code group. They had duplicate
paper pads printed with lines of random number groups. Each page had a
serial number and eight lines. Each line had six 5-digit numbers. A page
would be used as a work sheet to encode a message and then destroyed.
The serial number of the page would be sent with the encoded message.
The recipient would reverse the procedure and then destroy his copy of
the page. The German foreign office put this system into operation by
1923.^[11] <#cite_note-kahn-11>

A separate notion was the use of a one-time pad of letters to encode
plaintext directly as in the example below. Leo Marks </wiki/Leo_Marks>
describes inventing such a system for the British Special Operations
Executive </wiki/Special_Operations_Executive> during World War II
</wiki/World_War_II>, though he suspected at the time that it was
already known in the highly compartmentalized world of cryptography, as
for instance at Bletchley Park </wiki/Bletchley_Park>.^[13]
<#cite_note-marks-13>

The final discovery was by Claude Shannon </wiki/Claude_Shannon> in the
1940s who recognized and proved the theoretical significance of the
one-time pad system. Shannon delivered his results in a classified
report in 1945, and published them openly in 1949.^[4]
<#cite_note-shannon-4> At the same time, Vladimir Kotelnikov
</wiki/Vladimir_Kotelnikov> had independently proved absolute security
of the one-time pad; his results were delivered in 1941 in a report that
apparently remains classified.^[14] <#cite_note-kotelnikov-14>


    Example[edit </w/index.php?title=One-time_pad&action=edit&section=2>]

Suppose Alice </wiki/Alice_and_Bob> wishes to send the message "HELLO"
to Bob </wiki/Alice_and_Bob>. Assume two pads of paper containing
identical random sequences of letters were somehow previously produced
and securely issued to both. Alice chooses the appropriate unused page
from the pad. The way to do this is normally arranged for in advance, as
for instance 'use the 12th sheet on 1 May', or 'use the next available
sheet for the next message'.

The material on the selected sheet is the /key/ for this message. Each
letter from the pad will be combined in a predetermined way with one
letter of the message. (It is common, but not required, to assign each
letter a numerical value, e.g., "A" is 0, "B" is 1, and so on.)

In this example, the technique is to combine the key and the message
using modular addition </wiki/Modular_arithmetic>. The numerical values
of corresponding message and key letters are added together, modulo 26.
So, if key material begins with "XMCKL" and the message is "HELLO", then
the coding would be done as follows:

      H       E       L       L       O  message
   7 (H)   4 (E)  11 (L)  11 (L)  14 (O) message
+ 23 (X)  12 (M)   2 (C)  10 (K)  11 (L) key
= 30      16      13      21      25     message + key
=  4 (E)  16 (Q)  13 (N)  21 (V)  25 (Z) (message + key) mod 26
      E       Q       N       V       Z  → ciphertext

If a number is larger than 26, then the remainder after subtraction of
26 is taken in modular arithmetic fashion. This simply means that if the
computations "go past" Z, the sequence starts again at A.

The ciphertext to be sent to Bob is thus "EQNVZ". Bob uses the matching
key page and the same process, but in reverse, to obtain the plaintext
</wiki/Plaintext>. Here the key is /subtracted/ from the ciphertext,
again using modular arithmetic:

       E       Q       N       V       Z  ciphertext
    4 (E)  16 (Q)  13 (N)  21 (V)  25 (Z) ciphertext
-  23 (X)  12 (M)   2 (C)  10 (K)  11 (L) key
= -19       4      11      11      14     ciphertext – key
=   7 (H)   4 (E)  11 (L)  11 (L)  14 (O) ciphertext – key (mod 26)
       H       E       L       L       O  → message

Similar to the above, if a number is negative then 26 is added to make
the number zero or higher.

Thus Bob recovers Alice's plaintext, the message "HELLO". Both Alice and
Bob destroy the key sheet immediately after use, thus preventing reuse
and an attack against the cipher. The KGB </wiki/KGB> often issued its
agents </wiki/Espionage> one-time pads printed on tiny sheets of "flash
paper"—paper chemically converted to nitrocellulose
</wiki/Nitrocellulose>, which burns almost instantly and leaves no
ash.^[15] <#cite_note-15>

The classical one-time pad of espionage used actual pads of minuscule,
easily concealed paper, a sharp pencil, and some mental arithmetic
</wiki/Mental_arithmetic>. The method can be implemented now as a
software program, using data files as input (plaintext), output
(ciphertext) and key material (the required random sequence). The XOR
</wiki/XOR> operation is often used to combine the plaintext and the key
elements, and is especially attractive on computers since it is usually
a native machine instruction and is therefore very fast. However, it is
difficult to ensure that the key material is actually random, is used
only once, never becomes known to the opposition, and is completely
destroyed after use. The auxiliary parts of a software one-time pad
implementation present real challenges: secure handling/transmission of
plaintext, truly random keys, and one-time-only use of the key.


      Attempt at cryptanalysis[edit
      </w/index.php?title=One-time_pad&action=edit&section=3>]

To continue the example from above, suppose Eve intercepts Alice's
ciphertext: "EQNVZ". If Eve had infinite time, she would find that the
key "XMCKL" would produce the plaintext "HELLO", but she would also find
that the key "TQURI" would produce the plaintext "LATER", an equally
plausible message:

    4 (E)  16 (Q)  13 (N)  21 (V)  25 (Z) ciphertext
−  19 (T)  16 (Q)  20 (U)  17 (R)   8 (I) possible key
= −15       0      −7       4      17     ciphertext-key
=  11 (L)   0 (A)  19 (T)   4 (E)  17 (R) ciphertext-key (mod 26)

In fact, it is possible to "decrypt" out of the ciphertext any message
whatsoever with the same number of characters, simply by using a
different key, and there is no information in the ciphertext which will
allow Eve to choose among the various possible readings of the ciphertext.


    Perfect secrecy[edit
    </w/index.php?title=One-time_pad&action=edit&section=4>]

One-time pads are "information-theoretically secure
</wiki/Information_theoretic_security>" in that the encrypted message
(i.e., the ciphertext </wiki/Ciphertext>) provides no information about
the original message to a cryptanalyst </wiki/Cryptanalyst> (except the
maximum possible length^[16] <#cite_note-16> of the message). This is a
very strong notion of security first developed during WWII by Claude
Shannon </wiki/Claude_Shannon> and proved, mathematically, to be true
for the one-time pad by Shannon about the same time. His result was
published in the /Bell Labs Technical Journal/ in 1949.^[17]
<#cite_note-Shannon-17> Properly used, one-time pads are secure in this
sense even against adversaries with infinite computational power.

Claude Shannon proved, using information theory
</wiki/Information_theory> considerations, that the one-time pad has a
property he termed /perfect secrecy/; that is, the ciphertext /C/ gives
absolutely no additional information </wiki/Information> about the
plaintext </wiki/Plaintext>. This is because, given a truly random key
which is used only once, a ciphertext can be translated into /any/
plaintext of the same length, and all are equally likely. Thus, the /a
priori </wiki/A_priori_(philosophy)>/ probability of a plaintext message
/M/ is the same as the /a posteriori </wiki/Empirical_knowledge>/
probability of a plaintext message /M/ given the corresponding
ciphertext. Mathematically, this is expressed as /H/(/M/)=/H/(/M/|/C/),
where /H/(/M/) is the entropy </wiki/Information_entropy> of the
plaintext and /H/(/M/|/C/) is the conditional entropy
</wiki/Conditional_entropy> of the plaintext given the ciphertext /C/.
Perfect secrecy is a strong notion of cryptanalytic difficulty.^[4]
<#cite_note-shannon-4>

Conventional symmetric encryption algorithms use complex patterns of
substitution and transpositions. For the best of these currently in use,
it is not known whether there can be a cryptanalytic procedure which can
reverse (or, usefully, partially reverse) these transformations without
knowing the key used during encryption. Asymmetric encryption algorithms
depend on mathematical problems that are thought to be difficult to
solve, such as integer factorization </wiki/Integer_factorization> and
discrete logarithms </wiki/Discrete_logarithm>. However, there is no
proof that these problems are hard, and a mathematical breakthrough
could make existing systems vulnerable to attack.

Given perfect secrecy, in contrast to conventional symmetric encryption,
OTP is immune even to brute-force attacks. Trying all keys simply yields
all plaintexts, all equally likely to be the actual plaintext. Even with
known plaintext, like part of the message being known, brute-force
attacks cannot be used, since an attacker is unable to gain any
information about the parts of the key needed to decrypt the rest of the
message. The parts that are known will reveal /only/ the parts of the
key corresponding to them, and they correspond on a strictly one-to-one
basis; no part of the key is dependent on any other part.


    Problems[edit </w/index.php?title=One-time_pad&action=edit&section=5>]

Despite Shannon's proof of its security, the one-time pad has serious
drawbacks in practice because it requires:

  * Truly random (as opposed to pseudorandom </wiki/Pseudorandomness>)
    one-time pad values, which is a non-trivial requirement. See
    Pseudorandom number generator </wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator>.
  * Secure generation and exchange of the one-time pad values, which
    must be at least as long as the message. (The security of the
    one-time pad is only as secure as the security of the one-time pad
    exchange).
  * Careful treatment to make sure that it continues to remain secret,
    and is disposed of correctly preventing any reuse in whole or
    part—hence "one time". See data remanence </wiki/Data_remanence> for
    a discussion of difficulties in completely erasing computer media.

One-time pads solve few current practical problems in cryptography. High
quality ciphers are widely available and their security is not
considered a major worry at present.^[/when?
</wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items>/] ^[/citation
needed </wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/] Such ciphers are almost
always easier to employ than one-time pads; the amount of key material
which must be properly generated and securely distributed is far
smaller, and public key cryptography </wiki/Public_key_cryptography>
overcomes this problem.^[18] <#cite_note-schneierotp-18>


      Key distribution[edit
      </w/index.php?title=One-time_pad&action=edit&section=6>]

Further information: Key distribution </wiki/Key_distribution>

Because the pad, like all shared secrets </wiki/Shared_secret>, must be
passed and kept secure, and the pad has to be at least as long as the
message, there is often no point in using one-time padding, as one can
simply send the plain text instead of the pad (as both can be the same
size and have to be sent securely). However, once a very long pad has
been securely sent (e.g., a computer disk full of random data), it can
be used for numerous future messages, until the sum of their sizes
equals the size of the pad. Quantum key distribution
</wiki/Quantum_key_distribution> also proposes a solution to this problem.

Distributing very long one-time pad keys is inconvenient and usually
poses a significant security risk.^[1] <#cite_note-Numbers_Stations-1>
The pad is essentially the encryption key, but unlike keys for modern
ciphers, it must be extremely long and is much too difficult for humans
to remember. Storage media such as thumb drives </wiki/Thumb_drive>,
DVD-Rs </wiki/DVD-R> or personal digital audio players
</wiki/Digital_audio_player> can be used to carry a very large
one-time-pad from place to place in a non-suspicious way, but even so
the need to transport the pad physically is a burden compared to the key
negotiation protocols of a modern public-key cryptosystem, and such
media cannot reliably be erased securely by any means short of physical
destruction (e.g., incineration). A 4.7 GB DVD-R full of one-time-pad
data, if shredded into particles 1 mm² in size, leaves over 4 megabits
</wiki/Megabit> of (admittedly hard to recover, but not impossibly so)
data on each particle.^[/citation needed
</wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/] In addition, the risk of compromise
during transit (for example, a pickpocket </wiki/Pickpocket> swiping,
copying and replacing the pad) is likely to be much greater in practice
than the likelihood of compromise for a cipher such as AES
</wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard>. Finally, the effort needed to
manage one-time pad key material scales </wiki/Scalability> very badly
for large networks of communicants—the number of pads required goes up
as the square of the number of users freely exchanging messages. For
communication between only two persons, or a star network
</wiki/Star_network> topology, this is less of a problem.

The key material must be securely disposed of after use, to ensure the
key material is never reused and to protect the messages sent.^[1]
<#cite_note-Numbers_Stations-1> Because the key material must be
transported from one endpoint to another, and persist until the message
is sent or received, it can be more vulnerable to forensic recovery
</wiki/Computer_forensics> than the transient plaintext it protects (see
data remanence </wiki/Data_remanence>).


      Authentication[edit
      </w/index.php?title=One-time_pad&action=edit&section=7>]

As traditionally used, one-time pads provide no message authentication
</wiki/Authentication>, the lack of which can pose a security threat in
real-world systems. For example, an attacker who knows that the message
contains "meet jane and me tomorrow at three thirty pm" can derive the
corresponding codes of the pad directly from the two known elements (the
encrypted text and the known plaintext). The attacker can then replace
that text by any other text of exactly the same length, such as "three
thirty meeting is cancelled, stay home", The attacker's knowledge of the
one-time pad is limited to this byte length, which must be maintained
for any other content of the message to remain valid. This is a little
different from malleability </wiki/Malleability_(cryptography)>^[19]
<#cite_note-19> where it is not taken necessarily that the plaintext is
known. /See also/ stream cipher attack </wiki/Stream_cipher_attack>.

Standard techniques to prevent this, such as the use of a message
authentication code </wiki/Message_authentication_code> can be used
along with a one-time pad system to prevent such attacks, as can
classical methods such as variable length padding
</wiki/Padding_(cryptography)> and Russian copulation
</wiki/Russian_copulation>, but they all lack the perfect security the
OTP itself has. Universal hashing </wiki/Universal_hashing> provides a
way to authenticate messages up to an arbitrary security bound (i.e.,
for any p>0, a large enough hash ensures that even a computationally
unbounded attacker's likelihood of successful forgery is less than p),
but this uses additional random data from the pad, and removes the
possibility of implementing the system without a computer.


      True randomness[edit
      </w/index.php?title=One-time_pad&action=edit&section=8>]

High-quality random numbers are difficult to generate. The random number
generation functions in most programming language
</wiki/Programming_language> libraries are not suitable for
cryptographic use. Even those generators that are suitable for normal
cryptographic use, including /dev/random </wiki//dev/random> and many
hardware random number generators
</wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator>, may make some use of
cryptographic functions whose security has not been proven.

In particular, one-time use is absolutely necessary. If a one-time pad
is used just twice, simple mathematical operations can reduce it to a
running key cipher </wiki/Running_key_cipher>. If both plaintexts are in
a natural language (e.g., English or Russian or Irish) then, even though
both are secret, each stands a very high chance of being recovered by
heuristic </wiki/Heuristic> cryptanalysis, with possibly a few
ambiguities. Of course the longer message can only be broken for the
portion that overlaps the shorter message, plus perhaps a little more by
completing a word or phrase. The most famous exploit of this
vulnerability occurred with the Venona project
</wiki/Venona_project>.^[20] <#cite_note-nsa-20>


    Uses[edit </w/index.php?title=One-time_pad&action=edit&section=9>]


      Applicability[edit
      </w/index.php?title=One-time_pad&action=edit&section=10>]

</wiki/File:PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg>
</wiki/File:PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg>
Any digital data storage device </wiki/Data_storage_device> can be used
to transport one-time pad data.

Despite its problems, the one-time-pad retains some practical interest.
In some hypothetical espionage situations, the one-time pad might be
useful because it can be computed by hand with only pencil and paper.
Indeed, nearly all other high quality ciphers are entirely impractical
without computers. Spies can receive their pads in person from their
"handlers." In the modern world, however, computers (such as those
embedded in personal electronic devices such as mobile phones
</wiki/Mobile_phone>) are so ubiquitous that possessing a computer
suitable for performing conventional encryption (for example, a phone
which can run concealed cryptographic software) will usually not attract
suspicion.

  * The one-time-pad is the optimum cryptosystem with theoretically
    perfect secrecy.
  * The one-time-pad is one of the most practical methods of encryption
    where one or both parties must do all work by hand, without the aid
    of a computer. This made it important in the pre-computer era, and
    it could conceivably still be useful in situations where possession
    of a computer is illegal or incriminating or where trustworthy
    computers are not available.
  * One-time pads are practical in situations where two parties in a
    secure environment must be able to depart from one another and
    communicate from two separate secure environments with perfect secrecy.
  * The one-time-pad can be used in superencryption
    </wiki/Superencryption>.^[21] <#cite_note-21>
  * The algorithm most commonly associated with quantum key distribution
    </wiki/Quantum_key_distribution> is the one-time pad.
  * The one-time pad is mimicked by stream ciphers </wiki/Stream_cipher>.
  * The one-time pad can be a part of an introduction to
    cryptography.^[22] <#cite_note-22>


      Historical uses[edit
      </w/index.php?title=One-time_pad&action=edit&section=11>]

One-time pads have been used in special circumstances since the early
1900s. In 1923, it was employed for diplomatic communications by the
German diplomatic establishment.^[23] <#cite_note-23> The Weimar
Republic </wiki/Weimar_Republic> Diplomatic Service began using the
method in about 1920. The breaking of poor Soviet
</wiki/Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics> cryptography by the British
</wiki/United_Kingdom>, with messages made public for political reasons
in two instances in the 1920s, appear to have induced the U.S.S.R. to
adopt one-time pads for some purposes by around 1930. KGB </wiki/KGB>
spies are also known to have used pencil and paper one-time pads more
recently. Examples include Colonel Rudolf Abel </wiki/Rudolf_Abel>, who
was arrested and convicted in New York City </wiki/New_York_City> in the
1950s, and the 'Krogers' (i.e., Morris </wiki/Morris_Cohen_(spy)> and
Lona Cohen </wiki/Lona_Cohen>), who were arrested and convicted of
espionage in the United Kingdom </wiki/United_Kingdom> in the early
1960s. Both were found with physical one-time pads in their possession.

A number of nations have used one-time pad systems for their sensitive
traffic. Leo Marks </wiki/Leo_Marks> reports that the British Special
Operations Executive </wiki/Special_Operations_Executive> used one-time
pads in World War II to encode traffic between its offices. One-time
pads for use with its overseas agents were introduced late in the
war.^[13] <#cite_note-marks-13> A few British one-time tape cipher
machines include the Rockex </wiki/Rockex> and Noreen </wiki/Noreen>.
The German Stasi </wiki/Stasi> Sprach Machine was also capable of using
one time tape which East Germany, Russia, and even Cuba used to send
encrypted messages to their agents.^[24] <#cite_note-Sprach_Machine-24>

The World War II </wiki/World_War_II> voice scrambler </wiki/Scrambler>
SIGSALY </wiki/SIGSALY> was also a form of one-time system. It added
noise to the signal at one end and removed it at the other end. The
noise was distributed to the channel ends in the form of large shellac
records which were manufactured in unique pairs. There were both
starting synchronization and longer-term phase drift problems which
arose and were solved before the system could be used.

The NSA </wiki/NSA> describes one-time tape systems like SIGTOT
</w/index.php?title=SIGTOT&action=edit&redlink=1> and 5-UCO
</wiki/5-UCO> as being used for intelligence traffic until the
introduction of the electronic cipher based KW-26 </wiki/KW-26> in
1957.^[25] <#cite_note-25>

The hotline </wiki/Moscow-Washington_hotline> between Moscow
</wiki/Moscow> and Washington D.C. </wiki/Washington_D.C.>, established
in 1963 after the Cuban missile crisis </wiki/Cuban_missile_crisis>,
used teleprinters </wiki/Teleprinter> protected by a commercial one-time
tape system. Each country prepared the keying tapes used to encode its
messages and delivered them via their embassy in the other country. A
unique advantage of the OTP in this case was that neither country had to
reveal more sensitive encryption methods to the other.^[26] <#cite_note-26>

U.S. Army Special Forces used one-time pads in Vietnam. By using Morse
code with one-time pads and continuous wave radio transmission (the
carrier for Morse code), they achieved both secrecy and reliable
communications.^[/citation needed </wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>/]

During the 1983 Invasion of Grenada </wiki/Invasion_of_Grenada>, U.S.
forces found a supply of pairs of one-time pad books in a Cuban
warehouse.^[27] <#cite_note-27>

Starting in 1988, the African National Congress
</wiki/African_National_Congress> (ANC) used disk-based one-time pads as
part of a secure communication </wiki/Secure_communication> system
between ANC leaders outside South Africa </wiki/South_Africa> and
in-country operatives as part of Operation Vula
</w/index.php?title=Operation_Vula&action=edit&redlink=1>, a successful
effort to build a resistance network inside South Africa. Random numbers
on the disk were erased after use. A Belgian airline stewardess acted as
courier to bring in the pad disks. A regular resupply of new disks was
needed as they were used up fairly quickly. One problem with the system
was that it could not be used for secure data storage. Later Vula added
a stream cipher keyed by book codes to solve this problem.^[28]
<#cite_note-28>

A related notion is the one-time code
</wiki/Code_(cryptography)#One-time_code>—a signal, used only once,
e.g., "Alpha" for "mission completed", "Bravo" for "mission failed" or
even "Torch" for "Allied invasion of French Northern Africa
</wiki/Operation_Torch>" ^[29] <#cite_note-29> cannot be "decrypted" in
any reasonable sense of the word. Understanding the message will require
additional information, often 'depth' of repetition, or some traffic
analysis </wiki/Traffic_analysis>. However, such strategies (though
often used by real operatives, and baseball </wiki/Baseball> coaches)
are not a cryptographic one-time pad in any significant sense.


      Exploits[edit
      </w/index.php?title=One-time_pad&action=edit&section=12>]

While one-time pads provide perfect secrecy if generated and used
properly, small mistakes can lead to successful cryptanalysis:

  * In 1944–1945, the U.S. Army </wiki/U.S._Army>'s Signals Intelligence
    Service </wiki/Signals_Intelligence_Service> was able to solve a
    one-time pad system used by the German Foreign Office for its
    high-level traffic, codenamed GEE.^[30] <#cite_note-30> GEE was
    insecure because the pads were not completely random—the machine
    used to generate the pads produced predictable output.
  * In 1945, the US discovered that Canberra </wiki/Canberra>–Moscow
    </wiki/Moscow> messages were being encrypted first using a code-book
    and then using a one-time pad. However, the one-time pad used was
    the same one used by Moscow for Washington, DC
    </wiki/Washington,_DC>–Moscow messages. Combined with the fact that
    some of the Canberra–Moscow messages included known British
    government documents, this allowed some of the encrypted messages to
    be broken.
  * One-time pads were employed by Soviet </wiki/Soviet_Union> espionage
    agencies for covert communications with agents and agent
    controllers. Analysis has shown that these pads were generated by
    typists using actual typewriters. This method is of course not truly
    random, as it makes certain convenient key sequences more likely
    than others, yet it proved to be generally effective because while a
    person will not produce truly random sequences they equally do not
    follow the same kind of structured mathematical rules that a machine
    would either, and each person generates ciphers in a different way
    making attacking any message challenging. Without copies of the key
    material used, only some defect in the generation method or reuse of
    keys offered much hope of cryptanalysis. Beginning in the late
    1940s, US and UK intelligence agencies were able to break some of
    the Soviet one-time pad traffic to Moscow </wiki/Moscow> during WWII
    as a result of errors made in generating and distributing the key
    material. One suggestion is that Moscow Centre personnel were
    somewhat rushed by the presence of German troops just outside Moscow
    in late 1941 and early 1942, and they produced more than one copy of
    the same key material during that period. This decades-long effort
    was finally codenamed VENONA </wiki/Venona_project> (BRIDE had been
    an earlier name); it produced a considerable amount of information,
    including more than a little about some of the Soviet atom spies
    </wiki/Atom_spies>. Even so, only a small percentage of the
    intercepted messages were either fully or partially decrypted (a few
    thousand out of several hundred thousand).^[31] <#cite_note-31>
